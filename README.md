# I-don-t-like-Github
I don't like Github.

Its unnessescarily complicated for simple tasks that otherwise every file manager could perform better


Lets take pull requests for example. Just to suggest a small edit on ONE file, you have to clone the whole codebase,
make the ONE change on the cloned codebase on your side, then suggest to the original codebase to import the whole codebase
from your side.

This is so pointless, you could just directly suggest a edit like every other normal web platform for working 
together with other people can do.


Oh and the real fun starts if you already suggested an edit in the past and your fork is outdated. Is there a simple way
to sync the two again, I mean you are only using it for submitting edits?

Obviously not. lol.
You first gotta use pull requests again. Once you located the button you have to ensure the pull request direction is 
correct, then you have to create a pull request, and on the next page you have to confirm it.
All of that could have been solved with a "idgaf just update my damn copy so I can suggest an edit to the original" button,
but no, welcome to Github.

I might add more to this in the future on my travel through the amzingly complicated world of GH

Yes, this is a little ironical and not all points are 100% true. 

However, it does show my initial frustration with Github. As Brian Tanner correctly stated, its useful WHEN you understand the workflow. And exactly that is where for me the root of the issue is. Github itself, at least to me, didn't really introduce me to its workflow nicely. Based on that are the issues I've had. And while its not bad if multiple people do something on a project, that Github watches that there aren't multiple people trying to change the same variable to different values, it seems overkill it does so too for a project that I own and that no one else has ever commited to? If I try to change something, I as the owner should have the option to just forcefully do so and not try to make the program happy first.

And thats a general thing. Options that might be useful for large stuff should not need to control small projects and go against the project owners will, but the project owner should represent the last instance when it comes to wether changes happen to a project or not, and not a Program.

This might be just me, but a edit&suggest button in Wiki style would be a much more obvious and faster workflow than the current methods, as it currently just makes me feel like "it has always been like that, we got used to it so its okay" from the userbase.
