I don't like Github.

Its unnessescarily complicated for simple tasks that otherwise every file manager could perform better


Lets take pull requests for example. Just to suggest a small edit on ONE file, you have to clone the whole codebase,
make the ONE change on the cloned codebase on your side, then suggest to the original codebase to import the whole codebase
from your side.

This is so pointless, you could just directly suggest a edit like every other normal web platform for working 
together with other people can do.


Oh and the real fun starts if you already suggested an edit in the past and your fork is outdated. Is there a simple way
to sync the two again, I mean you are only using it for submitting edits?

Obviously not. lol.
You first gotta use pull requests again. Once you located the button you have to ensure the pull request direction is 
correct, then you have to create a pull request, and on the next page you have to confirm it.
All of that could have been solved with a "idgaf just update my damn copy so I can suggest an edit to the original" button,
but no, welcome to Github.
